# Graduation_Project_LIFESIGN AI Model
a glove that can understand the sign language and could turn in to speech, to unmute the mute.


 # Data Collection and Data Pre-processing:
taking the data from actual conditions of the flex sensors, i.e., when they are attached on fingers and the readings actually measure the bending of each finger. 
Data Pre-processing: In this phase,we cleaning the collected data

# Feature Extraction and selection:
For better training and prediction, some extra features were extracted from the dataset.

# Gesture Recognition:
Converting hand gestures as input to text which will be done by a machine in real time, All processed data were trained, validated and tested on different machine learning models. For our classification task

# Result:
done by running all the machine learning algorithms on the dataset
