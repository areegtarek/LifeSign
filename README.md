# Graduation_Project_LIFESIGN AI Model
a glove that can understand the sign language and could turn in to speech, to unmute the mute.


 **Data Collection and Data Pre-processing:**
 
taking the data from actual conditions of the flex sensors, i.e., when they are attached on fingers and the readings actually measure the bending of each finger. 
Data Pre-processing: In this phase,we cleaning the collected data

**Feature Extraction and selection:**

For better training and prediction, some extra features were extracted from the dataset.

**Gesture Recognition:**

Converting hand gestures as input to text which will be done by a machine in real time, All processed data were trained, validated and tested on different machine learning models. For our classification task

**Result:**

done by running all the machine learning algorithms on the dataset
